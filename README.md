## Reflective summary
This project was built indipendently, but the protocall used in the project was made together with a team of 7 students. While working on this project I improved my understanding of computer networks as I had to implement a chat room based on our protocall. Communication with the team was crutial to ensure that everyone was on the same page about how the protocall worked and that we interperated it the same way. This project alsp helped me understanding the importance of thurough debugging and good comments in the code. It also made me more aware of the importance of colaboration and comunication when working with a team.
